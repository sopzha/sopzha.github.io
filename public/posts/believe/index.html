  <section><p>A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with a friend about faith. She is
Christian; I am not.</p>
<p>I told her that being Christian is inconvenient for me. My social circles are
not predominantly Christian, and there are ideas in the Bible &mdash; like treating
homosexuality as a sin &mdash; that I simply don&rsquo;t feel comfortable adopting as my
own.</p>
<p>She seemed dismayed. <em>How can you live your life without structure and rules?
What&rsquo;s stopping you from committing murder? If we all simply believe what&rsquo;s
convenient, the world will be utter chaos.</em></p>
<p>First of all, if the only thing stopping someone from committing murder is
a book (albeit a pretty good one), they likely have some moral deficiency. I
would argue that even in a lawless society where murder is not a crime, the
number of murders wouldn&rsquo;t increase significantly compared to today.
I have faith that most people &mdash; Christian or not &mdash; have a moral
compass that transcends the law or any set of explicit religious rules, which
discourages us from killing people and allows society to maintain relative
order. While Christians may root our
inherent morality in an external being called God, I don&rsquo;t think it necessary
to do so in order to recognize that we have morals.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think we&rsquo;re understating the impact of convenience, even among
Christians. It is convenient for my friend to be Christian; she grew
up in a Christian household and is surrounded by Christian friends every day.
It&rsquo;s also convenient that Christianity is an attractive religion &mdash; it
guarantees
its believers an unconditionally loving father and the possibility of eternal
life after death. Had Christianity been founded on a system of regularly
subjecting oneself to pain, I doubt it would&rsquo;ve stuck around for so long. In
fact, I&rsquo;d argue my friend encountered Christianity in large part due to
convenience.</p>
<p>I believe that not only do we already believe what&rsquo;s convenient, but we should
continue to do so. If we suffer a loss and need an emotional anchor, why not
pray to God? If we happen to be gay, why adopt a faith that identifies us
as sinners? There&rsquo;s already so much in life we can&rsquo;t control; the least we can
do for ourselves is to believe in something that makes life suck less.</p>
<p>For example, one group who may find it convenient to adopt some established
religion is
the small subset of people who would only commit murder in a lawless society,
lest they become ostracized for their psychotic tendencies.
Even if their moral compass is misaligned, they (as shown in our hypothetical
experiment) can keep their impulses in
check through external forces, like laws. If those laws additionally took the
form of a religious text, that religion could (together with the influence of
man-made law) supplant their impulses
and help them lead lives that benefit society.</p>
<p>I appreciate that my Christian friends openly discuss their faith and share
their beliefs
with non-Christians &mdash; not because I think everyone should be
Christian, but because it&rsquo;s helpful to understand our options. As people like
myself are exploring what belief systems
work for us, we can adopt an existing religion fully, take bits and pieces from
multiple ones, or reject them entirely, depending on our unique experiences and
needs.</p>
<p>One might think that the freedom I propose in choosing our
beliefs undermines the validity of any religion. But I wonder if validity
is that important. Scientific facts we once held as absolute truths have been
disproven. Yet even in eras when people believed the galaxy revolved around
the Earth, they lived perfectly content lives. In fact, people who fought the
status quo in search of the truth lived arguably less enjoyable lives. Though
perhaps for them, scientifically backed claims is more satisfying than
societal acceptance, thus it is more convenient to fight for a heliocentric
system. In either case, the reality that people choose to accept is one that
they feel compelled to believe in.</p>
<p>Using convenience to defend the
reason for your beliefs &mdash; whether that means aligning them with compelling
scientific evidence or
with personal needs &mdash; seems far more reasonable and less arrogant to me than
asserting your belief is the sole truth.</p>
<p>Nothing is more real than what you choose to believe. Believe in something if you
want. Believe in nothing if you&rsquo;re comfortable with that, too. Share your
belief, but don&rsquo;t expect the same response from everyone.</p>
